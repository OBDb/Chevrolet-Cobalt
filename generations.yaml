    description: "The North American Chevrolet Cobalt was a compact car that replaced the Cavalier in Chevrolet's lineup. Built on GM's Delta platform, it was available as a two-door coupe or four-door sedan. Engine options included 2.2L and 2.4L Ecotec four-cylinders, with the performance-oriented SS models featuring either a supercharged 2.0L (2005-2007) or a turbocharged 2.0L (2008-2010) engine producing up to 260 HP in the highest-spec SS coupe. The interior was basic but functional, with materials quality that reflected its budget-friendly positioning. Safety features were gradually improved throughout its production, with side airbags and stability control eventually becoming available. Despite criticism for its interior quality and refinement, the Cobalt SS variants received praise for their performance, with the turbocharged model setting competitive lap times against more expensive sports cars."

    description: "The international version of the Chevrolet Cobalt, unrelated to the North American model, was a subcompact sedan developed primarily for emerging markets in South America, Asia, and Eastern Europe. Built on GM's GEM (Global Emerging Markets) platform, it featured simple, functional styling with a focus on interior space and practicality. Typically powered by 1.4L to 1.8L four-cylinder engines depending on the market, with manual or automatic transmission options. The interior prioritized space efficiency and durability over premium materials, with basic technology features by modern standards. This Cobalt was positioned as an affordable, practical family sedan for markets where value and low operating costs were primary considerations. In some regions, it was replaced by models like the Chevrolet Onix Plus or continued to be sold alongside newer designs. The international Cobalt represented GM's strategy of developing specific, cost-effective vehicles for emerging markets rather than directly adapting North American or European models."
